This merge is a major update to VDD, encompassing nearly a year's
worth of changes.  The most major change is the updated of the
Selenium libraries to 2.25.0.  That change broke much of the alert
handling and many of the subsequent changes deal with that fallout.
Many new events and event attributes have been added, as well as
command line arguments and cmdopts.  Much work was also done toward
getting VDD to work on Windows against IE.  As always, in addition to
the externally-visible changes, a great deal of work was done to the
internals of VDD to increase speed, reliability, and maintainability.

= New Features =

 * New events: <option>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <i>, <b>,
               <strike>, <s>, <u>, <th>, <email>
 * New attributes: jscriptevent for <image>, exists and required for
                   many events, format for <timestamp>, timeout for <alert>,
                   assert/assertnot for <td>, multiselect for <select>
 * New options: --profile, --eventtimeout, --webdriverlog
 * Text search optimizations (Java's regex engine is slow and this
   helps with that).
 * Ability to maximize and restore browser window

= Bugs Fixed =

 * 44048: Need the ability to assert duplicated options in select list.
 * 53899: The assertpage feature does not appear to be working.
 * 54159: Voodoo fails on "required" attribute for td tag
 * 54613: li elements cannot be accessed by the text attribute.
 * 55085: Inproper behavior of VooDoo after 'Frame' event
 * 55464: A number of tags still don't work in VDD.

 * 61860: Failure Error: Invalid attribute for ALERT event: 'timeout'
 * 61883: Dev version of Voodoo fails to assert on $ correctly.
 * 61884: Dev version of Voodoo fails to assert on regexps correctly
 * 61891: VDD doesn't try to do an assert for <td> element
 * 62013: VDD doesn't execute commands inside <link></link> sctructure
 * 62326: JavaScript handling is unexpectedly dismissing modal dialogs.

The merge is mostly bug fixes, with a few minor enhancements.  Support

many test scripts to fail.

This merge updates VooDooDriver's plugin interface.  Now, instead of
passing individual arguments with "command-line" args, the element,
and the browser object, a single opaque object containing all useful
information is passed in.  See the javadocs for PluginInterface and
PluginData for more information.

= New Features =

 * Plugins now are passed PluginData with much more runtime information

= Bugs Fixed =

 * 50365: Please give plugins read-only access to Voodoo/Soda vars.
